# Fast Github
Upload your projects to Github in a snap!  

Start a new project, run Fast Github and go. That's all there is to it.

## Installation

Install the Fast Github gem globally so it can be ran anywhere on your system

    $ gem install fast_github

Make sure you have done the following before you upload a repo:

* [Install Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Add SSH Key to Github](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)

## Usage

Change directories into the directory you wish to upload to Github

```
cd ~/myproject
```

Run the Fast Github binary from the directory

```
$ fast_github
```

It will prompt you for your github credentials and ask you to confirm you want to add this directory to Github.

That's it! You're done.
